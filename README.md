# pwspice

This is a circuit simulation software implemented by Yan Pei and Yanghan Wang.

• Developed a software version of HSPICE by QT4 with novel time-efficient structure to organize information
• Supported 10 devices: resistors, capacitors, inductors, controlled sources(4), diode nodes and MOSFETS(2)
• Supported 3 simulation option including .dc, .ac, .tran and various adjustable simulation parameters
